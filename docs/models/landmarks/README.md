# Landmark Models

Upload files to **`public/models/landmarks/`**. `npm run download:aristotle`
fetches `aristotle_tomb.glb` into this folder so the game can load Aristotle's
Tomb in both development and production builds.

Use these canonical names for additional uploads:

- `aristotle_tomb.glb`
- `poseidon_temple.glb`
- `akropol.glb`

Legacy names (e.g., `poseidon_temple_at_sounion_greece.glb`, `Akropol.glb`) are
still supported as fallbacks, but prefer the canonical names for new assets.
