# Building Models

Add GLB building assets (e.g., Parthenon) to this directory.

Aristotle's Tomb now lives under `public/models/landmarks/`. Run the download
script and it will place the GLB there automatically:

```
SKETCHFAB_TOKEN=<your token> npm run download:aristotle
```

Tokens are available from https://sketchfab.com/settings/password.
