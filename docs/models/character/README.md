# Hero Character Asset

The runtime expects a GLB named `hero.glb` in this folder. When you add or update
the model, run `npm run build` so the asset is copied into
`docs/models/character/hero.glb` for GitHub Pages. The Git repository ignores the
binary so history stays reviewable; keep a local copy or rely on your own asset
pipeline when deploying.
